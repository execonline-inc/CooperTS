# CooperTS.io

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

If you haven't already, run the bootstrap command in the root CooperTS directory:

```bash
yarn bootstrap
```

Then, run the development server in the same root directory:

```bash
yarn docs dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
