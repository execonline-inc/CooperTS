# rubeTS

Â CooperTS is an opinionated ecosystem for building web apps with React Typescript.

# Not a Framework

CooperTS is a collection of libraries, design patterns, and strongly-held opinions that we think make building web apps fun, easy, and a joy to maintain.

Eventually CooperTS will include tooling to help you implement some of the design patterns quickly.

## Opinions
- Null is not a good representation of nothing. 
- JSON from API endpoints should be validated against our expectations as it is decoded
- Side effects should be implemented as reactions
- Typechecking is preferable to writing tests to validate types

## Design Patterns
- Decoders
- Reactions
- Stores
- Error handling
- API calls
- API data design (based on HATEOAS)
