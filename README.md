# CooperTS

CooperTS is a library that takes TypeScript's basic premise (syntax for types in JavaScript) and cranks it up to 11. This means more time building cool projects and features and less time scratching your head on error messages.

* **Types:** I can't imagine any types better than these.
* **Functions:** These are our functions and why they're incredible.
